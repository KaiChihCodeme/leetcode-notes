I think this is a classic backtracking problem. And I found that backtracking has a template, we can use this template to implement the backtracking problem.

Back-tracking will use recursive to iterate all possible paths. We can use the level to calculate the possible path and a storage data structure (such as list or string) to store the possible paths.

This kind of solution must be practice more, for getting familiar with the back-tracking implementation. It is kind of similar to DFS questions.
