## My solution
I can address this solution by myself, in implementing the DFS to solve. But I cannot reach some edge cases, so I need to fine tune it after completing the first edition.

And my solution need to go through every path and every possible sum, so it took N^2 which is not efficiently.

## Prefix Sum
It's ambious and not easy to imagine in my thoughts. In my first thought, I suppose that we can employ memorization to avoid the duplicate calculation. But I don't know how to implement the memorization in this question.

After I refer to the solution of Prefix Sum, they use `cur - target` as old to solve the problem, and it's not easy to understand to me. I think I need to enhance my knowledge about using prefix sum to solve the problems in going through the all paths.
