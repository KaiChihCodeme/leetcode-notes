# 241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses
I cannot address this problem directly. I refer to [huahua](https://zxi.mytechroad.com/blog/leetcode/leetcode-241-different-ways-to-add-parentheses/) for the problem clarification. And I tried to implement the solution with the concept huahua provided.

In the sum, we need to use recursion (or DFS) to divide the operation to the smaller part, then combine then back to iterate all possible paths. (Also the divide and conquer solution)
Also, we can use memorization skill to solve this problem due to the operation may repetitive happend.

And the DFS solution is quite similar to recursion + memo solution, it only use more python-built-in function to solve the problem.
