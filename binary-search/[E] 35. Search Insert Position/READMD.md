# 35. Search Insert Position
This is a very basic and classic problem for binary search. We just need to find out the index of target number or find out the position it can be inserted. And we can find that we can insert target number when left index is greater than or equal to right.

However, in my solution, my right index may be wrong in the formal logic. So please refer to `35-formal.py` for more accuracy solution. And here exist a post process from this insert position, which must be noted.
