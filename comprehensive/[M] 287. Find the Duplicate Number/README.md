## My Solution
In my first thought, I chose to use Hashset to address this problem, which is straightforward, efficiently as well.

## Binary Search Solution
This solution calculate count as a base, to narrow down the scope of the repetitive numbers. But it is kind of tricky and it is not intuitive for me to figure out this solution.
